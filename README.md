# ProductList

## Author: Sara Gray

I wanted to take the example given on the [Thinking in React](#https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) page and build it by myself using the model outlined

    const PRODUCTS =
        [
            {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$49.99", stocked: true, name: "Football"},
            {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$9.99", stocked: true, name: "Baseball"},
            {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$29.99", stocked: false, name: "Basketball"},
            {category: "Electronics", price: "$99.99", stocked: true, name: "iPod Touch"},
            {category: "Electronics", price: "$399.99", stocked: false, name: "iPhone 5"},
            {category: "Electronics", price: "$199.99", stocked: true, name: "Nexus 7"}
        ];

We have five components in our app.

- FilterableProductTable (orange): contains the entirety of the example
- SearchBar (blue): receives all user input
- ProductTable (green): displays and filters the data collection based on user input
- ProductCategoryRow (turquoise): displays a heading for each category
- ProductRow (red): displays a row for each product

Components that appear within another component in the mock should appear as a child in the hierarchy:

- FilterableProductTable

  - SearchBar
  - ProductTable

    - ProductCategoryRow
    - ProductRow


# Build A Static Version in React

The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity. It’s best to decouple these processes because building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing. We’ll see why.

Build a static version of your app that renders your data model and pass data using props. Don’t use state at all to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don’t need it.

You can build top-down or bottom-up.

In simpler examples, it’s usually easier to go top-down, and on larger projects, it’s easier to go bottom-up and write tests as you build.

The components will only have render() methods since this is a static version of your app. The component at the top of the hierarchy (FilterableProductTable) will take your data model as a prop. If you make a change to your underlying data model and call ReactDOM.render() again, the UI will be updated. You can see how your UI is updated and where to make changes. React’s one-way data flow (also called one-way binding) keeps everything modular and fast.


# Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State

To make your UI interactive, you need to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React achieves this with state.

To build your app correctly, you first need to think of the minimal set of mutable state that your app needs.

The key here is DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself.

Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else you need on-demand.

Think of all of the pieces of data in our example application. We have:

- The original list of products
- The search text the user has entered
- The value of the checkbox
- The filtered list of products

Let’s go through each one and figure out which one is state. Ask three questions about each piece of data:

- Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
- Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
- Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

The original list of products is passed in as props, so that’s not state. The search text and the checkbox seem to be state since they change over time and can’t be computed from anything. And finally, the filtered list of products isn’t state because it can be computed by combining the original list of products with the search text and value of the checkbox.

So finally, our state is:

- The search text the user has entered
- The value of the checkbox


# Identify Where Your State Should Live

OK, so we’ve identified what the minimal set of app state is. Next, we need to identify which component mutates, or owns, this state.

Remember: React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy. It may not be immediately clear which component should own what state.

Follow these steps to figure it out:

For each piece of state in your application:

- Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
- Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
- Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
- If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.

Let’s run through this strategy for our application:

ProductTable needs to filter the product list based on state and SearchBar needs to display the search text and checked state.
The common owner component is FilterableProductTable.
It conceptually makes sense for the filter text and checked value to live in FilterableProductTable
Cool, so we’ve decided that our state lives in FilterableProductTable. First, add an instance property this.state = {filterText: '', inStockOnly: false} to FilterableProductTable’s constructor to reflect the initial state of your application. Then, pass filterText and inStockOnly to ProductTable and SearchBar as a prop. Finally, use these props to filter the rows in ProductTable and set the values of the form fields in SearchBar.

You can start seeing how your application will behave: set filterText to "ball" and refresh your app. You’ll see that the data table is updated correctly.


# Add Inverse Data Flow

So far, we’ve built an app that renders correctly as a function of props and state flowing down the hierarchy. Now it’s time to support data flowing the other way: the form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in FilterableProductTable.

React makes this data flow explicit to help you understand how your program works, but it does require a little more typing than traditional two-way data binding.

If you try to type or check the box in the current version of the example, you’ll see that React ignores your input. This is intentional, as we’ve set the value prop of the input to always be equal to the state passed in from FilterableProductTable.

Let’s think about what we want to happen. We want to make sure that whenever the user changes the form, we update the state to reflect the user input. Since components should only update their own state, FilterableProductTable will pass callbacks to SearchBar that will fire whenever the state should be updated.

We can use the onChange event on the inputs to be notified of it. The callbacks passed by FilterableProductTable will call setState(), and the app will be updated.
